# Installation
---------------------

You can install Hegel CLI using npm or yarn:

```bash
$ npm install -g @hegel/cli
# or
$ yarn global add @hegel/cli
```

Or install localy only for your project:

```bash
$ npm install -D @hegel/cli
# or
$ yarn add -D @hegel/cli
```

And run Hegel inside your project:

```bash
$ hegel
No errors!
```

## Setup Project

Also you will need to setup a compiler which will strip away Hegel types. The same as Flow, you can choose between Babel and [flow-remove-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flow-remove-types).

```bash
$ npm i -D @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-flow
```

After that you need to create a .babelrc file at the root of your project with next content:

```json
{
  "presets": [["@babel/preset-flow", { "all": true }]]
}
```

Now you can run it manualy:

```bash
$ npx babel directory_with_your_project_files/ -- -d compilation_destination_directory
```

Or you can add script inside your package.json:

```json
{
  "name": "your-project",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "babel directory_with_your_project_files/ -d compilation_destination_directory/",
  }
}
```

And run it by:
```bash
$ npm run build
```
