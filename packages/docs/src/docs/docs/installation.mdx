## Installation

You can install Hegel CLI using npm or yarn:

```sh
npm install -g @hegel/cli
# or
yarn global add @hegel/cli
```

And run Hegel inside your project:

```bash
$ hegel
No errors!
```

## Setup Project

Also you will need to setup a compiler which will strip away Hegel types. The same as Flow, you can choose between Babel and flow-remove-types.

```sh
npm i -D @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-flow
```

After that you need to create a .babelrc file at the root of your project with next content:

```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-flow"]
}
```

Now you can run it manualy:

```sh
npx babel directory_with_your_project_files/ -- -d compilation_destination_directory
```

Or you can add script inside your package.json:

```json
{
  "name": "your-project",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "babel directory_with_your_project_files/ -d compilation_destination_directory/",
  }
}
```

And run it by:
```bash
npm run build
```
